      "The trick to unleashing their value—but one that most people are too distracted to try these days—is reading them from cover. Doing so, you’ll get a decent history and cultural lesson that will help you better appreciate what you experience and you’ll discover festivals, events, destinations, and attractions that info-regurgitating bloggers and Instagram “influencers” don’t know of.",

    content:
      "Studying local phrases before you travel is a waste of time. You’ll learn everything you need to know, like how to say “please,” “thank you,” and “hello,” out of necessity pretty much immediately when you get there. If you want to study the local language before you go, learn something out of the ordinary. For example, “I’m from Canada and do handstands for exercise.” Locals won’t see it coming and will find it hilarious. And, unlike a standard “hello” or “thank you,” such an unusual phrase will make you new friends and open new doors to extraordinary travel stories.",

      "Not all airport currency exchange offices are rip-offs. Some offer the best rates in town. At Mexico City’s airport, the currency exchange booths will pay you to take US dollars off their hands. Seriously. So try to have extra pesos on hand before you leave and do exchange your money at the airport. Currency exchange booths at Cairo’s airport are similar. They have such a high demand for US dollars that they offer better-than-market-rates to get them from you.",

      "If you get hurt, the first thing you need to do (once you’re done screaming and crying in pain or sickness) is call your insurer. If not, there’s a chance they won’t approve of the hospital or treatment you chose and won’t fully cover you. And if you’re too hurt or sick to call, whoever’s looking after you needs to know who to talk to, so have the contact number on you.",

This helps us plan our itineraries when we’re traveling (by trying to make routes that go from one saved place to the next). And when we’re wandering around aimlessly we can pull up our maps to see if there are any nearby places of interest.",
